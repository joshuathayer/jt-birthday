# A party!

We're throwing a party on September 11 to celebrate making it through a couple of rough years, the glory of September in California (assuming the air is breathable), and Josh's 46th birthday.

There will be music, singing, and merriment in the garden. 

You should be there, it's going to be awesome!

## Important parking note

Parking is extremely limited at the house! Please park [down the hill on San Anselmo Ave](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Yolanda+Station,+San+Anselmo,+CA+94960/38+Savannah+Road,+San+Anselmo,+CA/@37.9780242,-122.5743984,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8085975ae268cceb:0xe034dd47dce17fec!2m2!1d-122.5721962!2d37.9794927!1m5!1m1!1s0x8085971a3832def7:0xe23bef4efbf62a13!2m2!1d-122.5733087!2d37.9776979!3e2). We'll be running a shuttle (please text Josh at (415) 307-2876 for a lift), but it's a quick and pleasant walk back up the hill to the house as shown. Of course, feel free to drop off people and head back down the hill.

**I am a musician! Should I bring my Eurorack modular? How about my bouzouki? Crumhorn?** Most of the musician people coming play Irish and/or American folk music, so if you're down to hang in those traditons, yes! Otherwise, there will be more information forthcoming about participation.

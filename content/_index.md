# A party!

We're throwing a party on September 11 to celebrate making it through a couple of rough years, the glory of September in California (assuming the air is breathable), and Josh's 46th birthday.

There will be music, singing, and merriment in the garden. 

You should be there, it's going to be fun!

Party starts at 2 PM and will be going late.

## Important parking note

Parking is extremely limited at the house! Please park [down the hill on San Anselmo Ave](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Yolanda+Station,+San+Anselmo,+CA+94960/38+Savannah+Road,+San+Anselmo,+CA/@37.9780242,-122.5743984,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8085975ae268cceb:0xe034dd47dce17fec!2m2!1d-122.5721962!2d37.9794927!1m5!1m1!1s0x8085971a3832def7:0xe23bef4efbf62a13!2m2!1d-122.5733087!2d37.9776979!3e2).


It's a quick and pleasant walk up the hill to the house as shown in the link. If you're not up for the walk, we'll be running a shuttle up the hill between 2:30 and 4:30, and going back down between 6:00 and 8:00. Meet the shuttle at the little parking lot on the corner of Redwood and San Anselmo Ave (the "Black Rabbit Trading Company").

Of course, feel free to drive up to drop people/stuff off, and head back down the hill.

Text Josh at (415) 307-2876 or Maria Thayer (415) 317-0306 if there's any confusion.

## RSVP!

Please let me know if you're able to make it, and if so how many friends / partners / kids / parents / others you're thinking of bringing. I want to know how much I should worry about the cops coming. joshuamilesthayer@gmail.com


## Special notes

We're living in weird times- fires and COVID could potentially look different in September than they do now. If things take a turn for the worse, we may have to change plans a bit. Please stay tuned for any updates.

**I am a musician! Should I bring my Eurorack modular? How about my bouzouki? Crumhorn?** Most of the musician people coming play Irish and/or American folk music, so if you're down to hang in those traditons, yes! Otherwise, there will be more information forthcoming about participation.

**I live far away and am concerned about getting home after a day of partying in the sun** Fear not. You're welcome to bring a sleeping bag and pad and sleep it off in the garden. Maybe let us know if you're considering that option.
